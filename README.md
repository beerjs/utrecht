BeerJS Utrecht
============

BeerJS Utrecht is for devs to get together, throw a few back, and learn collectively about JavaScript. We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both.

Topics so far have been around JavaScript, but in reality the scope is pretty open. We start the meetup by just hanging out and chatting then we will get into presentations. Anyone can present for any amount of time.

Location
-----------------
To be announced. Expect a nice beer-y place in the center of picturesque Utrecht. 

Date and time
-----------------
To be announced, as well. However, we're currently planning our first Beer JS Utrecht event in the first week of November. Perfect timing for some bo(c)k tasting? 

Want to hang out?
-----------------

We've yet to plan our first event, but are currently aiming to make it happen in the first week of november. More information will follow soon.

Want to share something?
-----------------------

You can show something you built, talk about something you would like to build, challenge "best" practices, or change the world; your call. Please let me know if you are interested so we don't double up.

Also feel free to come with problems and questions about your code, my code, or whatever.

Comment on the current meetings issue to formally request time or a topic.


Want to bring beer?
------------------

Of course you do.  Those with beer will be given priority seating ;)  Drinking beer is not required to participate though.


The Community
-------------

Community is the reason why we do what we do.  We highly value growing together and here are some places where you can do just that.  We can share relevant and cool content, questions, and start discussions... you get the idea.
